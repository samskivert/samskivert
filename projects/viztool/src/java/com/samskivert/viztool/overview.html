    <p> viztool is used to generate visualizations of collections of Java
      classes. These visualizations are intended to be printed out and
      taped to the wall or set on the desk beside you or folded into paper
      airplanes and sailed around the room. Thus viztool does not include
      a sophisticated user interface for viewing these presentations
      onscreen (use ghostscript for that), although you can actually
      display them on the screen because the rendering is done via the
      Java 2D rendering engine.

    <p> viztool aims to provide an extensible framework for generating
      visualizations of collections of classes. It currently generates
      inheritance diagrams organized by package, with information on
      interfaces implemented and (non-anonymous) inner classes as well.

    <p> It is a fairly small and simple collection of code, which is
       hopefully understandable enough on its own to allow one to dive in
       and create their own visualizations or enhance an existing
       one. Comments and contributions are always welcome.
