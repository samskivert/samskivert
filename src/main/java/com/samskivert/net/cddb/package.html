    Routines for accessing a CDDB server.

    <p> The {@link com.samskivert.net.cddb.CDDB} class provides the
      primary interface to the CDDB services. This service does not
      provide a means to obtain the CD identification information that
      you'll need to perform a CDDB lookup. In the application that
      motivated the creation of these services, a <code>cdparanoia</code>
      process was spawned to read the disc info. Other mechanisms surely
      exist.

    <p> Use of the CDDB class is fairly straightforward:

    <pre>
      CDDB cddb = new CDDB();
      cddb.connect("www.freedb.org");
      CDDB.Entry[] entries = cddb.query(discid, frameOffsets, length);
      for (int i = 0; i < entries.length; i++) {
          CDDB.Detail detail = cddb.read(entries[i].category,
                                         entries[i].discid);
          // do your thang now...
      }
    </pre>

    <p> These services presently do not provide a mechanism for submitting
      a CDDB entry (which involves sending an email). It surely will in
      the future.
