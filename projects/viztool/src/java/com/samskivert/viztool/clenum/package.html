    Provides the ability to enumerate over all classes in the classpath
    and filter those enumerations.

    <p> The main interface for enumerating classes is the {@link
      com.samskivert.viztool.enum.ClassEnumerator}. It scans through the
      class path and attempts to match a component enumerator to each
      component. The {@link
      com.samskivert.viztool.enum.DirectoryEnumerator} is used for all
      components that don't match one of the other (zip or jar)
      enumerators. These component enumerators are then used in turn to
      enumerate through all of the classes in the class path.

    <p> The enumeration can be filtered by making use of a {@link
    com.samskivert.viztool.enum.FilterEnumerator}.
